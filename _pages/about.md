I am a Ph.D. student in **Data Science** at the National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Bryan Kian Hsiang Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html){:target="_blank"}. I received my Bachelor of Science (Honors) in Data Science & Analytics and a minor in Computer Science from NUS in 2020. I am currently supported by the ISEP-IDS Scholarship jointly offered by the [NUS Graduate School Integrative Sciences and Engineering Programme](https://isep.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"} (ISEP) and the
[Institute of Data Science](https://ids.nus.edu.sg/){:target="_blank"} (IDS), and the [Singapore Data Science Consortium (SDSC) Dissertation Research Fellowship](https://sdsc.sg/fellowship/){:target="_blank"}.

Research Interests
======
My interests include, but not limited to, the following areas:
* Collaborative machine learning (e.g., data valuation, federated learning, incentives, fairness)
*	Resource-efficient machine learning (e.g., Bayesian optimization)
*	Deep learning & applications
